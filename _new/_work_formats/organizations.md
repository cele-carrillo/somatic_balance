Our corporate programs allow people to feel more alive and intune so they are able to articulate wants and needs,
develop a sense of closeness and understand how to effectively collaborate with their co-workers.

Although companies are investing  in the health and wellbeing of their employees, the current offerings miss the
mark, fall short, waste time, effort and money because they fail to have focused outcomes and experienced
practitioners.

The Centre of Sense provides useful, skills based, practical & accessible tools. Our goal is to support people and
enable them to respond in more organic ways in and out the office.


The sessions are informed to address: physical
tension, stress, mood disorders, disconnection to body and others, sense of isolation, lack of meaning and
purpose, enthusiasm, motivation and drive.
