Our workshops explore embodied curiosity to discover the potential of your senses. Some of the topics we work with
are: expression through sound, embodied mediation, awakening the senses, understanding the connection between
body, mind and emotion, how to set boundaries & negotiate consent, how disagreeing effectively improves
communication, confidence and trust, creativity as an embodied experience.
