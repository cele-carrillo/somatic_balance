You take a breath in and your body opens. You then breathe out and your body contracts. We open and close. Move to the left and then to the right. This is the natural flow of things. Being able to know when to open and when to close helps us feel safe, as well as balance and adjust our experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this exploration we play with inviting our body to contract and shorten, and then to expand and open up… pulsing between these two opposite actions, we start finding balance and inviting space in those areas - of our body and of our life - that might need it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s explore together.&lt;/p&gt;

body, emotions, and energy levels. Using breath and touch, we start learning how to energise and soothe our bodies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All you need is a bit of time, a space where you’re comfortable and feel safe, your curiosity and willingness to try.
The whole exploration takes less than 20 minutes, and people who have tried it have reported feeling more present,
relaxed, nurtured, and centred afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

- Daniel J. Siegel
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are not prisoners of our perceptions. We do have the power to decide what we want to pay attention to, and where we want to remove our attention from. But sometimes it does get a little tricky, doesn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can easily get overwhelmed by thoughts or emotions we feel we need to pay attention to. 
This meditation is here to help just with that: learning to aim our awareness so we’re free to choose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by Daniel Siegel’s Wheel of Awareness, this exploration is a great tool to start noticing what aspects of our
life we are focusing on the most during the day, and what aspects go unnoticed. So we can eventually have agency
regarding what we’re inviting into our lives. Curious?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s dive in!&lt;/p&gt;

And when people hear anything that sounds like criticism, they tend to invest their energy in self-defense or counterattack. If we wish for a compassionate response from others, it is self-defeating to express our needs by interpreting or diagnosing their behavior. Instead, the more directly we can connect our feelings to our own needs, the easier it is for others to respond to us compassionately.”

- Marshall B. Rosenberg, Nonviolent Communication: A Language of Life: Life-Changing Tools for Healthy Relationships
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time, we’re turning our minds to the ideas and insights around non-violent communication. This form of
communication teaches us that, to be able to connect with our needs, we first have to gain clarity about what’s alive in
us. In any given situation, there are many points of views and sometimes we’re quick to assume why others behave the way
they do. This can create confusion and lead to endless misunderstandings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful way to break that vicious cycle is to pause for a moment and ask ourselves: what’s the behaviour I can observe?
What do I actually see? And then, how does that make me feel? Am I sad, angry, happy? What’s alive in my heart then? And
what are my true needs? Do I need safety? Maybe it’s acknowledgement I’m needing, or connection. And now that I know my
need, how could I make a request that helps fulfill that need, without demanding or forcing people to do what I want?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s a simple practice that will help you have a deeper understanding of what you may be experiencing, and also one
that helps us get out of our heads!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Name the situation that’s troubling you: ………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg: My partner doesn’t understand me!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s see what happens when you can get more clarity by stating the following:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1- What’s the observable behavior or event? Not what you think, suppose or imagine, but what you actually
see/hear/observe:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I see&lt;/strong&gt; ………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg: I see them giving me advice on how to solve a problem at work.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2- What’s the fantasy that’s going on in your head about that  situation? WHat do you think/believe is happening?:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I imagine/think&lt;/strong&gt; ………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg: I imagine they want to find a solution so they won’t have to hear me talk about it.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3- What emotions are alive in you right now? Are you sad, happy, afraid, content, excited? This is not how others make
you feel (I feel abandoned), but the actual emotions you are experiencing:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I feel&lt;/strong&gt; ………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg: I feel sad, lonely and afraid.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;4- What’s the core need that needs to be met? Is it safety, connection, acknowledgement, love, privacy? This is not what
you want others to do, but your actual core need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I need&lt;/strong&gt; ………………………………………………&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eg: I need empathy and understanding. (Now we can say to our partners: “Could you please hear me out and empathise? I
don’t really need a solution right now, I just need reassurance that you are here for me.”)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you can identify your core needs, you can begin to think of ways to meet them - whether on your own or by clearly
communicating it to people you trust to support you. Try this exercise and let us know what you discover.&lt;/p&gt;

  really helpful. We can call this “Name it to tame it”... Your inner sea and your interpersonal relationships will all
  benefit from naming what is going on and bringing more integration into your life.”

  ― Daniel J. Siegel, Brainstorm: The Power and Purpose of the Teenage Brain
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s begin? I invite you to take a full, nurturing, rich breath, and as you let the air flow out effortlessly, bring
your attention to what you’re noticing in your body at this moment: it could be an emotion, a physical sensation, an
impulse towards doing… whatever it is, intend to find words to describe it - not explain or justify it, but describe it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is it in your body? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does it feel like? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What words can you put around it? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take as much time as you need to name what you’re noticing. And then take a few more deep breaths and repeat the process
one more time:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aim your awareness to what you’re noticing in your body, around your thoughts, or emotions, and whatever it is, intend
to find one or two words to describe it (don’t go into the story around it, just describe it). Again take time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Where is it in your body? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What does it feel like? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What words can you put around it? ……………………………………………….&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you’re feeling complete, take one more full breath in, and then notice how your experience of the present moment
has shifted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Has anything changed for you? How is it helpful to pause for a moment and notice what’s happening for you? We hope you
can bring this practice into everyday moments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever you find yourself feeling too overwhelmed and when it’s difficult to process your inner world, come back to
this and &lt;strong&gt;name it to tame it&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
