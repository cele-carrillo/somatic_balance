                Join us for weekly online contemplations, meditations, and self-discovery sessions where we delve into
                different aspects of ourselves using a somatic and integrative approach. These sessions are designed to
                help you learn a number of different practices to develop more embodied awareness, presence, equanimity,
                compassion and aliveness.

                During the sessions, you will also be guided to explore different aspects of your mental and emotional
                self, with the goal of supporting your self-discovery so you can create a more organic and congruent way
                of living and being.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our weekly explorations and self-discovery sessions will include topics such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>Curiosity and compassion - approaching life from a place of wonder and love.</li>
                    <li>Orienting from within - finding your own grounded center in your body, here and now.</li>
                    <li>Somatic breathing techniques and self-massage.</li>
                    <li>What stands in the way between myself and happiness right now?</li>
                    <li>What brings a sense of inspiration and purpose to my life?</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                In the sessions, our process is focused around creating and developing:
                <ul>

                    <li>Embodied awareness - reconnect the mind and body and learn to listen to your bodyâ€™s wisdom more intuitively</li>
                    <li>Presence - feel fully present in the everyday</li>
                    <li>Self-regulation - find balance and learn how to regulate your emotions and reactions, even through stressful moments</li>
                    <li>Compassion  - develop a deeper compassion for yourself</li>
                    <li>Curiosity - learn to get curious about emotions and responses without judgement</li>
                    <li>Integration - discover how you can integrate these learnings in your daily life</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
