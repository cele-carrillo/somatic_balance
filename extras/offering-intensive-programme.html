                    "This programme has given me tools to get out of situations that I thought were impossible to get
                    out of without the help of medication or psychiatry. It has helped me to lower my
                    anxiety, and to discover that I can be safe and feel safe in my own body. It has also given me
                    knowledge about my own body and my state of mind."

                    no solution. I thought that I was not able to relate to others, that generated a lot of anxiety.
                    Also at times I did not want to move on, I had no hope and life did not seem interesting... The
                    program helped me to be more compassionate towards myself and little by little I've started to feel
                    better."

                    available. It has improved my relationship with myself and with the people around me, giving us

                This programme was designed as part of my doctoral dissertation and the statistics from the data
                analysis showed that <strong>there has been a marked trend of improvement in participants' self-reported
                levels of anxiety and wellbeing.</strong><br>
                <strong>The top four reported benefits</strong>: awareness of inner state of arousal, capacity to
                self-regulate, improved social engagement and emotional well-being.
