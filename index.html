					Our aim is to go beyond the surface and gain a deeper understanding into who we are and what we need.
					We are here to help people work with the body instead of against it, to begin understanding how the physical body, mind and emotions are one.
				</p>
				<p class="editable">
					Using holistic bodywork and touch, somatic movement, breath, and sound we help people find physical comfort, release tension and relieve pain, increase body awareness, and learn how to deal with physical and emotional stress.

								<p>I choose Somatic Explorations because I wanted to feel more connected to my myself and my body, and ultimately work on my self-esteem. My biggest takeaway was that I was really disconnected from myself and my emotions. With Cele's guidance, I was able to learn why I experience particular feelings, emotions or self-limiting beliefs in certain situations and how to change these patterns.

								<p>The first session was really different from what I had expected. I loved that it was tailored, structured and goal orientated. I found the exercises really helpful and I liked that they were things I could easily integrate into my daily life. They made me feel calm, relaxed and grounded.

								<p>I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand themselves better, feel less stressed, more confident and more empowered. Cele's approach is really unique, I've seen other practitioners in the past and found this particular approach incredibly helpful.

								<p>I had Structural Integration sessions and they were great. My body was very tense and sore when I went to see her and I did not seem to be able to let go and feel relaxed. Through her expertise, Celeste slowly re-balanced my body and I started to learn a new way to relate to it. She knows what she is doing and makes you feel safe and relaxed. So relaxed in fact that I fell asleep during one of her sessions. Highly recommend her.
