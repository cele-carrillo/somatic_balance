        <h2>How to prepare?</h2>

        <p>
            Before your first session, we’ll have a chat and go over basic concepts regarding the nervous system and the
            physiological states you might find yourself in. We’ll also review the SSP and any questions you may have.
        </p>
        <p>
            In preparation for your sessions, there’s a few things that can help make your SSP experience even better:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Make sure you have enough time for the session and that you don't need to leave in a rush. If time is a
                concern, please let me know. It’s always best to do a shorter listening session and allows for some
                quiet time afterwards.
            </li>
            <li>
                You may choose to have a support person (friend, family, partner) to be with you during the session, or
                to pick you up afterwards so you don’t need to go through the stress of driving back home. Please let me
                know and I’ll make sure to welcome them and explain what they might expect and how they can best support
                you.
            </li>
            <li>
                You won’t be able to use your phone during the session, so please make sure you are not expecting any
                important calls or messages during our appointment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Feel free to wear comfortable, casual, soft clothing. Your comfort is a priority!
            </li>
            <li>
                You can choose to do any activities that you find relaxing during the session. Please let me know in
                advance so we can discuss them and make sure they are a good match for the SSP.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What happens during a session?</h2>

        <p>
            When you arrive for a session, we’ll have a brief chat and go over some practices that are usually helpful
            for down-regulating and supporting a calmed and relaxed state. These are tools meant to support you during
            the listening and make your experience more enjoyable. You’ll be in a nice, private, quiet, and comfortable
            room, and I’ll be around, in case you need any support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, the main thing that will happen is that you will be listening to music! And because that music has
            been filtered, it may sound funny or weird at times. Nothing to worry about, it’s meant to sound like that.
            As you are listening, I encourage you to listen to your body and respond to rather than resist what you
            would like. You may have a response to listening to the filtered music, and that response may be mild or
            strong, frequent or just once, or anything in between. Again, there is no right or wrong. I’ll be there to
            support you through the session so if you are in any doubt about anything, it is better to pause and share
            what you are experiencing. Also, you may not feel anything unusual at all. If so, you will just be relaxing
            and listening to music for an hour without stopping. The SSP will still be working!
        </p>
        <p>
            Also remember that there’s no expectation about how much listening will be done in any session. It will be
            guided by you and your needs. There is no right or wrong.
        </p>
        <p>
            And rather than speaking -so as not to ‘interrupt’ the listening- we’ll be communicating with thumbs up or
            down, so you can let me know if you are feeling ok or if we need to take a break.
        </p>

        <h2>What to expect during the intervention?</h2>

        <p>
            We all respond to this intervention in a different way, and you’ll need to pay close attention to the
            signals your body is sending to really understand what’s changing for you with each new session. Some people
            have reported noticing: more social interaction; changes in facial expressions; can more easily accept
            sounds that previously bothered them; a few nights of intense dreams that seem to quiet down after a few
            days and lead to improved sleep; improved capacity to focus; improved speech pace and modulation.
        </p>

        <h2>How to support the process during and afterward the intervention?</h2>

        <p>
            Listen to your body and be led by it. Pay attention to your needs. Be gentle with yourself. You may feel
            tired after a session, so it’s great to have some time to be slow and go easy about the rest of your day-
            something as simple as finding 5 or 10 minutes to be in the fresh air, have some quiet ‘me time’, or go for
            a walk could be great. Also simple self-care activities such as drinking lots of water, eating nourishing
            and easy-to-digest food, gentle exercise, fresh air, and plenty of sleep go a long way in supporting the
            process.
        </p>
        <p>
            ​As the days progress, explore what sort of support might be possible or suitable after the SSP has finished.
            The SSP is a ‘platform’ or ‘springboard’ for future growth and not a standalone tool. It is important that
            you follow up this experience by continuing or resuming therapy, experiencing supportive social engagement,
            and reflecting on the experience and how it made you feel. These steps are needed for the benefits to be
            sustained and built upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some people can feel a bit vulnerable while adjusting to the changes brought by the SSP - however these
            changes can bring great possibilities and opportunities if supported in an appropriate way. It is important
            you are in the right environment with healthy interactions and support for this change.
