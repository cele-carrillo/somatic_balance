Without even realising, we are constantly shaping an aspect of reality through our inner dialogue. We can create a great
relationship with ourselves, or a terrible one, just by the words we use. Have you ever stopped to consider how do you
actually talk to yourself? 

If I'm criticizing every step I take and every decision I make, then my life is going to feel quite challenging... on
the other hand, if I'm supporting myself with kind words of encouragement, I might be able to relax and enjoy more. 

How I talk to myself colors my inner landscape, brings me closer to certain emotions, makes certain thoughts more likely
to pop up, and has a certain feel. What does your inner landscape look like? What is your inner dialogue inviting into
your life? Is it creating space or constriction? Is it demanding or supporting? 

And what if you could change it? What if you could choose how to talk to yourself?
That's what we'll be exploring in this meditation, how to talk to ourselves in a way that's useful and intentional. I
invite you to join us and explore!
