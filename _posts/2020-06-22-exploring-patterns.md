Many times we get caught up in the stories present in our lives. We go over and over a situation in our minds, wondering
what's the meaning behind them.

*What did she mean by that?*

*How come he felt that way?*

*I'm not sure what to do next, what should I do?*

The more we try hard to understand, the more confusion we feel. The more messy it gets. And this can be quite
overwhelming and disempowering.

Something that has helped me in life is to leave the story behind, take a step back, breathe and observe what patterns
are creating the dynamics in the situation I'm trying to understand. Many times this gives me a clearer view and shows
light on some options and alternatives I hadn't noticed before.

This time the inspiration came from my beautiful friend, and amazing practitioner,
[Meredith Dolan](http://meredithdolan.ntpages.com.au){:target="_blank"}
who invited me to explore and play with a few patterns that are present in nature. The following exploration is the
result of that. Hope you like it!
