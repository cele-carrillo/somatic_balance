It can be difficult to tend to our needs when we don’t exactly know what to do especially during high-stress moments.
To help with that, we’ve designed a Mindfulness Menu where you can fill-in-the-blanks with bite-sized mindfulness
practices that work for you. 

Leave it on your fridge or take a picture of it, so you always have a handy guide to turn to. 
[Download the printable template](/res/mindfulness_menu.pdf) and check out some of our favourite ideas below:

We’d love to hear about the ideas that would go on your Mindfulness Menu!

[Contact us](/contact/) or tag us on [Instagram @balancebyceleste](https://www.instagram.com/balancebyceleste/) with a
picture of your menu. If you are needing additional support at the moment or want to learn how to deepen your
mindfulness practice, we are available for online sessions.
Drop us a message for more information: [hello@somaticbalance.com.au](mailto:hello@somaticbalance.com.au).
