We are always expanding and contracting in some way. You take a breath in and your body opens. You then breathe out and your body contracts. We open and close. Move to the left and then to the right. This is the natural flow of things. Being able to know when to open and when to close helps us feel safe, as well as balance and adjust our experience.

In this exploration we play with inviting our body to contract and shorten, and then to expand and open upâ€¦ pulsing between these two opposite actions, we start finding balance and inviting space in those areas - of our body and of our life - that might need it. 

Let's explore together.
