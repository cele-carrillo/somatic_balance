This Somatic Exploration is a great yet simple way to start regulating our nervous system, and finding balance in our
body, emotions, and energy levels. Using breath and touch, we start learning how to energise and soothe our bodies.

All you need is a bit of time, a space where you're comfortable and feel safe, your curiosity and willingness to try.
The whole exploration takes less than 20 minutes, and people who have tried it have reported feeling more present,
relaxed, nurtured, and centred afterwards.

Let's see what you discover!
