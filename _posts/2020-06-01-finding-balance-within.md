What comes up for you when you think of the word “Rigid” or “Inflexible”? Have you noticed your emotions, thoughts, or
even reactions being rigid and inflexible at times? And if so, how do you feel about that?

For many of us, acknowledging our rigid spots brings up criticism and judgment, and we immediately want to move away
from them: *“I shouldn't be rigid” ... “I have to be more flexible about that”...* But are you sure? How can you tell if
you need to be more flexible or not?

I believe that some rigidities can be helpful, while others can be damaging. Being too rigid causes you to make stubborn
decisions and throw the baby out with the bathwater. Being too flexible makes you a doormat. But how can we start to
find balance then? 

Well, this meditation is designed to help us with that: feeling for our rigid spots, acknowledging them, and then
checking their purpose and usefulness so we can let go of what it's not useful, and keep what we need. Let's explore
together!
