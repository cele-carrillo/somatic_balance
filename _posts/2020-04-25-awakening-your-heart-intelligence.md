Many cultures believe the heart, rather than the brain, is the centre of life and the source of true wisdom. In this
meditation we explore together awakening our heart intelligence<!--more-->, which the HeartMath Institutes defines as: 'The flow
of awareness and insight that we experience once the mind and emotions are brought into balance and coherence
through a self-initiated process. This form of intelligence is experienced as direct, intuitive knowing that manifests
in thought and emotions that are beneficial for ourselves and others.'

Sounds amazing, right? Let's give it a go.
