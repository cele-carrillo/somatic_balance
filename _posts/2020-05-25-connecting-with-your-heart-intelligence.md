What's been on your mind lately, and more importantly, what's been in your heart?<!--more--> For me, tuning into my
heart intelligence right now has been of the utmost importance. 

We are being challenged in many ways and it can be hard to know what advice to follow, what's the best course of action,
and what's the appropriate next step for us in the middle of all the uncertainty that's present. 

**And the thing is: there's NO one right thing to do.**

We cannot keep looking for a "one size fits all" solution and hope that it will make us happy or give us direction. What
we can do is, start coming back to ourselves. To find a place of truth and coherence from which to orient, where we draw
what's true for us and learn how to be congruent with that. That's exactly what tuning into our heart intelligence does
for us. **It reduces the noise, takes away the focus from the outside, and brings us into self-coherence.**

*"Heart intelligence is the flow of awareness, understanding and intuition we experience when the mind and emotions are
brought into coherent alignment with the heart. It can be activated through self-initiated practice, and the more we pay
attention when we sense the heart is speaking to us or guiding us, the greater our ability to access this intelligence
and guidance more frequently."*

I learned a simple yet beautiful and powerful practice from my teacher and mentor, [Joan Heartfield](https://talkinghearts.com/about-us/),
and I'd like to share it with you here:
