                The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) is designed to reduce stress and auditory sensitivity while enhancing
                social engagement and resilience. This non-invasive intervention involves listening to 5-hours of music
                that has been processed specifically to retune the nervous system to introduce a sense of safety and the
                ability to socially engage.

        <p>
            Based on the work of Dr. Stephen Porges, and his Polyvagal Theory, the program is derived from nearly four
            decades of research on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and social-emotional processes.
            It is designed to stimulate nervous system regulation by exercising and systematically challenging the
            auditory system with specifically processed music.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prosodic vocal music used has been filtered to train the middle ear muscles to focus in on the frequency
            envelope of human speech. Once human speech is properly perceived, the portal to social engagement has been
            opened. You'll find you are better able to interpret not only the meaning, but also the intent in
            conversations. And the sense of safety that is achieved by better understanding the fluctuations in human
            voice calms your physiological state. Once your system has been primed and your state is calm, further
            therapy is enhanced and behavioral regulation is improved.
        </p>
        <p>
            The SSP is a research-based therapy showing significant results in the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social and emotional difficulties.</li>
            <li>Auditory sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Anxiety and trauma related challenges.</li>
            <li>Inattention.</li>
            <li>Stressors that impact social engagement.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><div class="question">How does it work?</div>
        <div class="answer"><p><strong> The SSP uses the auditory system as a portal to the vagus complex, which controls our physiological state. Once physiological state is regulated, we can accelerate or enhance subsequent therapy. </strong>
</p><p>The music trains the auditory pathways by focusing on the frequency envelope of human speech. As the client learns to process these speech-related frequencies, they improve the functioning of two cranial nerves that are important for promoting overall social behavior. Cranial Nerve VII (Facial Nerve) helps clients focus on human voice and tune out irrelevant frequencies. Cranial Nerve X (Vagus Nerve) enables self-soothing and autonomic regulation.
</p><p>Following successful completion of the intervention, individuals will be better able to focus in school, therapy, and everyday life and experience a calmed emotional and physiological state. This is based on studies that suggest that skills such as attention, state regulation and the ability to engage socially will be enhanced.
</p></div><div class="question">How is the protocol delivered?</div>
        <div class="answer"><p>At present, in-person sessions is the format chosen to deliver this protocol. You are invited into my studio, and together we'll create a safe and comfortable environment, making sure that you have all the support required to complete this intervention successfully. We will also go over a few self-regulating practices and guidelines that will support further in regulating your nervous system.
</p></div><div class="question">How many sessions will I need? And how often?</div>
        <div class="answer"><p>The number and frequency of sessions is unique to each person. While some clients choose to do 5 sessions during 5 consecutive days and find great results, some others quite often benefit from shorter listening sessions spread over a longer period of time. The chosen frequency and duration of sessions ultimately depend on factors that are hard to predict in advance, such as the response of the nervous system, emotional response, your schedule, etc. To accommodate for this, in our initial consultation we'll set up a potential schedule for the sessions, and then adapt and change it as we observe how your nervous system responds to the intervention.
</p></div><div class="question">What is the cost of the protocol?</div>
        <div class="answer"><p>Since it's not possible to know in advance how many sessions will be necessary to complete the protocol, you will be charged a fixed fee, which means you will know beforehand (during our consultation) the investment required and don't have to worry about the number of sessions needed to complete the protocol. I'm happy to discuss payment plans so money is not an impediment in our journey to regulation!
</p></div><div class="question">When is this intervention appropriate?</div>
        <div class="answer"><p>The SSP is conceived as a passive pathway therapy helping to change the client's physiologic state through neuroception and opening the system to further neural change from other active pathway therapies that follow. This means SSP is not a stand alone therapy, but rather a platform for other therapies. So this intervention is best suited for those clients who have other support in place (E.g.: If you are having <a href="/modalities/somatic-explorations">Somatic Explorations</a> sessions with me or if you are already working with a mentalhealth professional or similar).
