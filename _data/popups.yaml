    As you may know, my time in Australia has come to an end and I have closed my professional practice. It's been a great pleasure
    working with each of you and as much as I'm excited about this new adventure in my life, I will genuinely miss working with you.
    </p>
    <p>
    The resources on this website will continue to be available until the end of 2023. I hope you find them useful.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thank you for your continuous support, and please do keep in touch.
    </p>

    If there's anything I can still do for you, don't hesitate to contact me.

    <p>With gratitude,</p>
