    I choose Somatic Explorations because I wanted to feel more connected to my myself and my body, and ultimately
    work on my self-esteem. My biggest takeaway was that I was really disconnected from myself and my emotions.
    With Cele's guidance, I was able to learn why I experience particular feelings, emotions or self-limiting beliefs
    in certain situations and how to change these patterns.

    The first session was really different from what I had expected. I loved that it was tailored, structured and goal
    orientated. I found the exercises really helpful and I liked that they were things I could easily integrate into my
    daily life. They made me feel calm, relaxed and grounded.

    I would recommend this to anyone who wants to understand themselves better, feel less stressed, more confident and
    more empowered. Cele's approach is really unique, I've seen other practitioners in the past and found this
    particular approach incredibly helpful.

    I had Structural Integration sessions and they were great. My body was very tense and sore when I went to see her and
    I did not seem to be able to let go and feel relaxed. Through her expertise, Celeste slowly re-balanced my body and
    I started to learn a new way to relate to it. She knows what she is doing and makes you feel safe and relaxed.
    So relaxed in fact that I fell asleep during one of her sessions. Highly recommend her.
