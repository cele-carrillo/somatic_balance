    - q: What is Rolfing® and how is it different from other forms of bodywork?
      a:
        - >
          Rolfing is a form of holistic, process-oriented bodywork developed by biochemist, Dr. Ida Rolf. The method differs
          from others because it takes gravity into account and understands the role it plays for our wellbeing. Dr.Ida
          recognised that gravity is an essential organising element for body structure, movement coordination, perception and
          human expression.
        - >
          Unlike other forms of bodywork, a Rolfer doesn't only take the entire body into account, they look at its structural
          and functional relationships too. Throughout a 10-session series, the entire fascia network of the body is
          addressed – with the goal of aligning it ideally in relation to gravity.

    - q: Can anyone try it? Who is Rolfing® for?
      a:
        - >
          Yes, anyone can try it. It is often used by athletes who want to achieve more efficient movement. It's also a
          frequently used by musicians, dancers and actors who want to expand their body awareness and ability to express
          themselves freely.
        - >
          After accidents and operations Rolfing can help those affected gain freer movement.
        - >
          Rolfing is for anyone who wants to have long-term, lasting improvements in their health and well-being. It is
          suitable for people of all ages. If you're experiencing any form of discomfort including back pain, neck tension,
          headaches, problems in the hips, knees or feet, Rolfing can help alleviate and treat the pain. If you're finding it
          difficult to recover after an accident or operation, Rolfing can also help you gain freer movement.

    - q: What happens during a Rolfing® session?
      a:
      - >
        Every session begins with a short observation phase. You could be asked to sit, stand, walk a few steps or to
        breathe deeply to assess your body and what it needs. You will then lie on a padded table, one similar to a massage
        table where the Rolfer delicately works on the fascia in a specific body area while applying precise pressure.
      - >
        You will usually supports the effects of Rolfing through active movement and thereby, also learn new movement
        patterns. Old habits that have a lasting effect on your well-being will be gradually eliminated.

    - q: How many sessions will I need?
      a:
      - >
        This really depends on your personal goals. If you'd like to release tension in a specific area of your body for a
        temporary amount of time, 1 to 3 sessions will suffice. However, if you'd like to experience lasting change in your
        overall wellbeing, the European Rolfing Association e.V. recommends the classic 10-session series developed by
        Dr. Ida Rolf in which each session builds upon the progress achieved in the previous one to get you back to being
        your best self.

    - q: Are there contraindications?
      a:
      - >
        Rolfing is not suitable for certain conditions including inflammations and tumours. In these cases, we strongly
        recommend consulting with your General Practitioner before proceeding with a session. In other cases, if you are
        unsure, please consult with your General Practitioner before starting a session or talk to us if you need more
        information.

  faqs:
    - q: What is Somatic Counselling?
      a:
      - >
        Somatic Counselling is a modality and process which helps us develop a deeper understanding and
        sense of trust in our own organic nature.
      - >
        The practice takes into the account the person as a whole being - understanding that through the process of
        integration of our conflicting needs, feelings, emotions, beliefs, and actions, we can start to reconnect with who
        we truly are and with what we truly need.

    - q: Who is this practice for?
      a:
      - >
        Somatic Counselling can help people of all ages, and with the most varied needs. If you're interested in
        improving your mind-body-emotions connection, increase your general well being, expand your body awareness and
        possibilities of expression or seek a deeper understanding into your emotions, Somatic Counselling is for
        you.

    - q: What happens during a session?
      a:
      - >
        You are welcomed into each session with a practice of mindfulness which will help us slow down, tune in and be
        present in that very moment.
      - >
        We will then establish the goals which you'd like to work on. This could range from physical tension, emotional
        responses or a pattern of behaviour you've seen come up in your life. The practitioner may ask you to stand, breathe
        deeply, take few steps, or pay attention to a prompt or exercise.
      - >
        The session continues using tools such as breath, contemplation, gestures, movement and noticing tension. We will
        begin to observe and deepen our understanding of how the present experience is organised, our beliefs around it and
        our physical and emotional response. You will be guided gently through the process where you can notice, understand
        and learn about your responses in a safe and organic manner.

    - q: How many sessions will I need?
      a:
      - >
        We recommend a minimum of 3 to 5 sessions to truly experience change and feel the benefits. Each session builds
        upon the progress achieved in the previous one and with each client, the progress may vary. Ultimately, this depends
        on your goals and the number of sessions required to reach the established goals and long-term benefits varies from
        person to person.

    - q: Are there contraindications?
      a:
      - >
        Somatic Counselling is not psychological or medical treatment. If you are experiencing extreme anxiety,
        depression or severe trauma, please talk to your general practitioner or psychologist about seeking the right
        help for what you're going through.
