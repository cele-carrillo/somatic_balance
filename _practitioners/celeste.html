    Celeste works with individuals and groups to go beyond the surface and gain a deeper understanding of who they are
    and what they need. Her aim is to help people work with the body instead of against it, to understand how the
    physical body, mind and emotions are connected. With 10 years experience in embodied practices she supports her
    clients to find and create more balance in their lives with a down-to-earth and accessible tools. Celeste approaches
    sessions with the intention of freeing the body, not ‘fixing it’.

            My journey with Structural Integration and Somatic Explorations began within myself. I was in IT Engineering when I felt a nudge within
            me to “move”... physically and in my life’s path. I felt frustrated and unfulfilled. I was doing what I was told I
            “should be doing” yet I was unhappy.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started looking into embodied counselling as a student and it taught me that most of my connection with the world was
            just not real, it was almost as if I was connected with my ‘fantasy’ or ‘idea’ of the world and of myself, but not my
            actual, true self. I began paying attention to the body and learned how it helps us return to who we really are. That
            catapulted my journey and obsession with how experiences are felt through the body, how those experiences then shape our
            reality and how body-mind-emotions work together.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of this has led me to see and believe that each one of us have everything within us to change and be happy... we
            just need to tune into that natural capacity, use and allow it to grow. My passion and ultimate goal with my clients is
            to help them stop struggling. This means I am here to help you reach your next available level of integration - be it
            physical, emotional, around beliefs or perceptions of the world. Everything we work on during the sessions can be
            applied to your daily life and will make a difference for you.

        <h3>A bit on my background</h3>
        <p>
            I have studied, worked and lived in Mendoza and Buenos Aires in Argentina where I completed my IT Engineering studies,
            became a Bach’s flowers practitioner, Yoga teacher and studied Ady-yoga with the founder. I still have weekly
            supervision sessions with him… it helps keep me sane. I then moved to Stockholm where I studied with various Structural Integration
            supervisors and mentors before hopping on a plane to Germany where continued my Structural Integration training
            and studied with mentors.
        </p>
        <p>
            A few years ago, I moved to Sydney and it has been a journey of continuous learning with a focus on workshops around
            mindfulness, somatic movement, and Structural Integration. I’m a constant student of the human expression and what makes us who we are.
