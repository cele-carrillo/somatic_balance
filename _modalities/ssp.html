 - question: How does it work?
   answer:
    - >
        <strong>
        The SSP uses the auditory system as a portal to the vagus complex, which controls our physiological state.
        Once physiological state is regulated, we can accelerate or enhance subsequent therapy.
        </strong>
    - >
        The music trains the auditory pathways by focusing on the frequency envelope of human speech. As the client
        learns to process these speech-related frequencies, they improve the functioning of two cranial nerves that
        are important for promoting overall social behavior. Cranial Nerve VII (Facial Nerve) helps clients focus on
        human voice and tune out irrelevant frequencies. Cranial Nerve X (Vagus Nerve) enables self-soothing and
        autonomic regulation.
    - >
        Following successful completion of the intervention, individuals will be better able to focus in school,
        therapy, and everyday life and experience a calmed emotional and physiological state. This is based on
        studies that suggest that skills such as attention, state regulation and the ability to engage socially will
        be enhanced.

 - question: How is the protocol delivered?
   answer:
    - >
        At present, in-person sessions is the format chosen to deliver this protocol. You are invited into my studio,
        and together we'll create a safe and comfortable environment, making sure that you have all the support
        required to complete this intervention successfully. We will also go over a few self-regulating practices and
        guidelines that will support further in regulating your nervous system.

 - question: How many sessions will I need? And how often?
   answer:
    - >
        The number and frequency of sessions is unique to each person. While some clients choose to do 5 sessions
        during 5 consecutive days and find great results, some others quite often benefit from shorter listening
        sessions spread over a longer period of time. The chosen frequency and duration of sessions ultimately depend on
        factors that are hard to predict in advance, such as the response of the nervous system, emotional response,
        your schedule, etc. To accommodate for this, in our initial consultation we'll set up a potential schedule for
        the sessions, and then adapt and change it as we observe how your nervous system responds to the intervention.

 - question: What is the cost of the protocol?
   answer:
    - >
        Since it's not possible to know in advance how many sessions will be necessary to complete the protocol, you
        will be charged a fixed fee, which means you will know beforehand (during our consultation) the investment
        required and don't have to worry about the number of sessions needed to complete the protocol.
        I'm happy to discuss payment plans so money is not an impediment in our journey to regulation!

 - question: When is this intervention appropriate?
   answer:
    - >
        The SSP is conceived as a passive pathway therapy helping to change the client's physiologic state through
        neuroception and opening the system to further neural change from other active pathway therapies that follow.
        This means SSP is not a stand alone therapy, but rather a platform for other therapies. So this intervention is
        best suited for those clients who have other support in place (E.g.: If you are having
        <a href="/modalities/somatic-explorations">Somatic Explorations</a> sessions with me or if you are already
        working with a mentalhealth professional or similar).

                The Safe and Sound Protocol (SSP) is designed to reduce stress and auditory sensitivity while enhancing
                social engagement and resilience. This non-invasive intervention involves listening to 5-hours of music
                that has been processed specifically to retune the nervous system to introduce a sense of safety and the
                ability to socially engage.

            Based on the work of Dr. Stephen Porges, and his Polyvagal Theory, the program is derived from nearly four
            decades of research on the relationship between the autonomic nervous system and social-emotional processes.
            It is designed to stimulate nervous system regulation by exercising and systematically challenging the
            auditory system with specifically processed music.
        </p>
        <p>
            The prosodic vocal music used has been filtered to train the middle ear muscles to focus in on the frequency
            envelope of human speech. Once human speech is properly perceived, the portal to social engagement has been
            opened. You'll find you are better able to interpret not only the meaning, but also the intent in
            conversations. And the sense of safety that is achieved by better understanding the fluctuations in human
            voice calms your physiological state. Once your system has been primed and your state is calm, further
            therapy is enhanced and behavioral regulation is improved.

            The SSP is a research-based therapy showing significant results in the following areas:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Social and emotional difficulties.</li>
            <li>Auditory sensitivities.</li>
            <li>Anxiety and trauma related challenges.</li>
            <li>Inattention.</li>
            <li>Stressors that impact social engagement.</li>
