                Welcome to session 10! Our last session of this wonderful journey towards safety, balance and wellbeing!
                I hope you have enjoyed every session and continue cultivating an inner experience of curiosity,
                compassion and safety. As always, please remember that to have a safe experience as you go through this
                unsupervised work, it is essential to be mindful of and respect your own limits, times and natural
                rhythms. Don't push yourself or go beyond what is comfortable or feels right for you. Feel free to
                pause, skip, or just leave for another moment any part of this class if it becomes overwhelming or
                challenging for you.

                Today we explore what we've discovered and learnt in this journey, the changes we have seen in ourselves
                and those areas we still want to work on. Remember to do this exploration grounded in your curiosity and
                compassion for yourself. As always, our intention is to cultivate a sense of inner safety and balance. I
                hope you enjoy it!

                After the exploration, whenever you're ready, I invite you to consider the following ideas and
                practices. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some time with yourself.
