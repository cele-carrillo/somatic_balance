                Welcome to session 2. Please remember that to have a safe experience as you go through this
                unsupervised work, it is essential to be mindful of and respect your own limits, times and natural
                rhythms. Don't push yourself or go beyond what is comfortable or feels right for you. Feel free to
                pause, skip, or just leave for another moment any part of this class if it becomes overwhelming or
                challenging for you.

                Today's exploration invites us to start creating a safe and strong connection to the present, to
                cultivate a sense of calm and security in our inner experience. I hope you enjoy it!

                practices. You'll find the template below. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some
                time with yourself before moving on to the next section.

                and see what starts to happen and change in your day to day experience. The more you play and use these
                tools, the more they will be accessible in challenging moments and the more changes you'll start noticing.
