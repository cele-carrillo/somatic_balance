                Welcome to session 5. I hope you're having a great time exploring yourself and discovering new aspects.
                As always, please remember that to have a safe experience as you go through this unsupervised work,
                it is essential to be mindful of and respect your own limits, times and natural rhythms. Don't push
                yourself or go beyond what is comfortable or feels right for you. Feel free to pause, skip, or just
                leave for another moment any part of this class if it becomes overwhelming or challenging for you.

                Today we start exploring how our inner state influences not only our view of the world around us and of
                ourselves but also how we respond to situations, sometimes even in unexpected ways. I hope you enjoy it!

                After the exploration, whenever you're ready, I invite you to consider the following ideas and
                practices. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some time with yourself before moving
                on to the next section.

                Feel free to spend as much time as you need with this section. It is meant to help you explore yourself

                <i>Practice makes the master</i>. I invite you to give these practices a try for the next 7 to 10 days
                and see what starts to happen and change in your day to day experience. The more you play and use these
                tools, the more they will be accessible in challenging moments and the more changes you'll start noticing.
