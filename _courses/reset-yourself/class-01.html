                Welcome to session 1! We hope you enjoy our first session together. Please remember that to have a safe
                experience as you go through this unsupervised work, it is essential to be mindful of and respect your
                own limits, times and natural rhythms. Don't push yourself or go beyond what is comfortable or feels
                right for you. Feel free to pause, skip, or just leave for another moment any part of this class if it
                becomes overwhelming or challenging for you.

                The invitation today is to explore different aspects of ourselves, different parts of who we are, with
                the intention of observing how we respond in the presence of life threat, danger, and safety.

                After the exploration, whenever you're ready, I invite you to consider the following ideas and
                practices. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some time with yourself before moving
                on to the next section.

                Feel free to spend as much time as you need with this section. It is meant to help you explore yourself
                even further and increase your awareness.

                and see what starts to happen and change in your day to day experience. The more you play and use these
                tools, the more they will be accessible in challenging moments and the more changes you'll start noticing.
