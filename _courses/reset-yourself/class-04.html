                Welcome to session 4. I hope you're having an enjoyable, rewarding and safe experience so far. As
                always, please remember that to have a safe experience as you go through this unsupervised work, it is

                Today we explore what's present in our inner experience of this moment and how that influences our view
                of the world around us and of ourselves. I hope you enjoy it!

                After the exploration, whenever you're ready, I invite you to consider the following ideas and
                practices. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some time with yourself before moving
                on to the next section.

                Feel free to spend as much time as you need with this section. It is meant to help you explore yourself
                even further and increase your awareness.

                and see what starts to happen and change in your day to day experience. The more you play and use these
                tools, the more they will be accessible in challenging moments and the more changes you'll start noticing.
