                Welcome to session 3! We hope you enjoy our first session together. Please remember that to have a safe
                experience as you go through this unsupervised work, it is essential to be mindful of and respect your
                own limits, times and natural rhythms. Don't push yourself or go beyond what is comfortable or feels
                right for you. Feel free to pause, skip, or just leave for another moment any part of this class if it
                becomes overwhelming or challenging for you.

            <p>
                Today we explore what's present in our inner experience of this moment. We aim to go beyond
                <i>what we already know</i> and get curious about what's present from an intellectual, emotional and
                somatic perspective. I hope you enjoy it!

            <p>
                After the exploration, whenever you're ready, I invite you to consider the following ideas and
                practices. You might want to journal, take notes, or simply spend some time with yourself before moving
                on to the next section.

            <p>
                Feel free to spend as much time as you need with this section. It is meant to help you explore yourself
                even further and increase your awareness.

                <i>Practice makes the master</i>. I invite you to give these practices a try for the next 7 to 10 days
                and see what starts to happen and change in your day to day experience. The more you play and use these
                tools, the more they will be accessible in challenging moments and the more changes you'll start noticing.
